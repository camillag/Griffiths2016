#Justification for choice
My research program is concerned with how racial bias can be implicitly and subtly communicated in interactions. The chosen paper tests whether people are able to infer the social identity of a speaker based on their language-use, specifically their use of Linguistic Intergroup Bias (LIB): the use of abstract language to describe in-group targets' desirable behaviors and concrete language to describe their undesirable behaviors (favorable LIB), and the use of concrete language for out-group targets' desirable behaviors and abstract language for their undesirable behaviors (unfavorable LIB). The paper includes 4 studies, each of which manipulates a *communicator's* use of either favorable or unfavorable LIB and measures participants' social categorization of the communicator. This will be useful for me and my research because I am always looking for new ways to measure bias in my studies, where I am observing teacher communication to students of different races in their written feedback. The LIB procedure may be an elegant way to capture bias in teachers' communication to students. Alternatively, I could see myself providing teachers with excerpts of writing from 'students' and testing whether they are able to infer the students' social identity from the text - as is suggested by the findings in this paper. 

#Procedure description
*I will likely try to reproduce studies 1a and 1b of the package, which follow the same exact simple procedure with slightly different manipulations. In each case, participants read a passage that begins "Imagine that someone is communicating with you about a man named Peter. Peter is American, has an interest in politics, and voted for Barack Obama." The manipulation follows in the second part of the passage, where participants read the communicator's description of Peter which used either favorable or unfavorable LIB. The dependent measure was participants' rating of the likelihood that the communicator was a Democrat/Republican in study 1a and a Christian/not a Christian in study 1b. Both studies also included a manipulation check. 
*The study includes supplemental materials for both study 1a and 1b, which include the passages and manipulations in full. This will make replicating the procedure much more feasible. The Ns for each study also seem quite feasible (90 and 120). The analyses of this data seem quite straightforward - calculating the mean differences in participants' inferences of social identity between the two LIB conditions.
